# COVID-19 County Stages

** Work in progress, please do not distribute or cite without permission. **

Updated 04-09-2020

Currently:
* Data only spans 31-Mar-2020 to 5-Apr-2020 as a test.

To-dos:
* Figure out how to run very large GeoJSON (possibly Sherlock)
* Improve the buffering of the files (too slow currently)
* Develop code to calculate stages based on number of new cases in past 7 days
* Include all data on map and Github
* Build slider instead of drop-down using min and max dates
* Add tooltips
